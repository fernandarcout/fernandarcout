I'm an advertiser and PhD in design from PUC–Rio with research carried out at the University of Strasbourg, FR, under the supervision of anthropologist David Le Breton. Considering I'm specialist in content production for different media (books, e-books, websites, email marketing and info graphics) my work focuses on creating material to inform, educate or entertain the customer and nurture the base of leads.

More than 20 years of experience in Institutional Communication, Advertising and Marketing in multinationals such as the PA Consulting Group and large organizations, such as the Olympic Committee in Brazil, where he served the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), which is headquartered in Canada. As partner and director of Squadra Publicidade, I created texts for clients from different segments: La Mole, Widmen, Oto Grupo:Clínica Otorrino, Golden Cross, among others.

I have great ability to research the most varied subjects. Flexible, I can easily keep up with market news. A refined critical sense allows me to see criticism as an opportunity for maturation and professional growth, generating delivery and commitment to the quality of work.
